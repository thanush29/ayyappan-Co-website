NOTES:
------
- The app works without EmailJS (forms still save to database)
- Email delivery is usually instant (< 1 minute)
- All form submissions are also saved in Supabase database
- Reply-to is set to customer's email for easy response
- Variables that are empty (like phone) will show as blank, not as {{variable}}
